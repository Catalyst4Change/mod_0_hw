my prime motivator to change my career is a feeling of stagnation that i have felt over the last few years. for most of my life i have been guided by self-improvement. at a certain point, at least career-wise, i reached a ceiling and I grew bored and complacent. i was very good at what i did and didn't have the motivation to continue learning.
eventually covid and other factors ended that career. in a scramble to continue existing, i got a job at a sandwich shop, and then at a computer repair company doing logistics. around the same time, my father passed away. so i found myself in a predicament where i had no reason to stick with what i was doing, and a rare moment of financial stability enough to stretch out and try something new.
I waffled on whether i wanted to go into coding or welding, as I like to build stuff and work with my hands. after talking with friends -including a turing graduate- i settled on the latter. so far i do not regret my decision; the curriculum and mindset behind it jive with how my brain works already.
