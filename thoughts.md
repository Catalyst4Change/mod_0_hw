success at Turing:
I find myself pretty quickly overwhelmed with everything, especially considering this is the part-time class. whoever, with diligent note-taking and focus i've come to understand most of what's being taught.
I found myself smiling when I didn't have to review any of the git commands before starting HW2. the file names turned green when I added them and i found that very satisfying.
A worry I have is about my relationships. I'm already feeling a sense of disconnection from my loves and again, this is just the part-time deal. I know that they will continue to love and support me thru this will nonetheless be a stressor on my social life.

strategies at Turing:
routine has never been a strong suit of mine. but i know the only way i'll be able to make this all work is if I buckle down and make myself do the things every day. I need to wake up early, have some quiet time, do the work/class, decompress and self-care before bed.
i will also need to offload some logistical concerns. instead of visiting the laundromat for hours each week, I'll utilize a drop-off service. same with food. I already don't like to cook so I expect to be having a lot of canned, prepackaged stuff and/or ordering a bunch of Chinese once a week and nibbling my way thru.

shout out:
i wanna give props to all my loves who have been supporting my endeavors for years. weather it's work, music, art, or my mental health, my polycule has been there for me when i needed them <3
